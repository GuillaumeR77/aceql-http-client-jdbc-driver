Introduction
------------

The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the AceQL HTTP APIs and 
eliminate the tedious works of handling communications errors and 
parsing JSON results.

Android and Java Desktop application developers can access 
remote SQL databases and/or SQL databases in the cloud by simply 
including standard JDBC calls in their code, just like 
they would for a local database.
